In this section of the report, the issues within subsections are ordered
 by criticality.
 Issues are categorized in the usefulness category if they refer to the
 content, although this may overlap with the fit for use section.
 If issues could fit into multiple categories, they are shown in the most
 relevant category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system goal for the AskAuckland web page is to provide information relating
 to a user's query regarding the University.
 Therefore, searching should be fast, easy, and accurate.
 The content should relate to students of the University (both current and
 future).
 Issues are things that hinder this ideal experience.

\begin_layout Subsection
Usefulness Issues

Searching does not appear to support the Maori language.
 As Maori is commonly spoken and an official language of NZ, there are accessibi

A simple search for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 has many results relating to academic integrity.
 However, academic integrity is never defined in the articles.
 Furthermore, none of the links in the articles leads to a definition of
 academic integrity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next to some articles, there is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 This lack of specificity limits the functionality of this feature.
 The time posted is essential for these articles as they may become outdated.
 An article from five years ago is not as relevant as one posted six months
 ago.

\begin_layout Standard
Looking for a lecture room is also difficult.
 It requires going to the sixth result after searching 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and requires four clicks to reach the city campus map pdf.
 This also makes it inefficient for use, as this process would need to be
 repeated each time.

\begin_layout Standard
When searching 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 with the coronavirus topic there is one result which is not relevant to

 This would be a fairly common question asked, but there does not appear

Further specifying the search by adding the

 topic reduces search results to just two results.

The implementation of topics seems to be faulty.
 The titles of some of the removed articles are

\begin_inset Quotes erd

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset

.
 These results would be useful for students, so having them filtered out
 when using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coronavirus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topic is counter-intuitive and not a good user experience.
 Therefore, the functionality of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

topics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is compromised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another potential issue with the topic feature is removing a topic from
 a search by clicking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Current students
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Ease of Learning Issues

\begin_layout Standard
Hover effects for links are variable, with most being underlined, but some
 being underlined and highlighted.

The search button does not get underlined or highlighted, only the mouse
 cursor is changed to a pointer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most clickable aspects are shown in blue.
 However, the current breadcrumb is clickable but not blue.
 A further question is why the current breadcrumb is clickable, as it provides
 no functionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another anti-pattern is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Typing in a word then hovering over the 'x' icon does not change the mouse
 cursor to a pointer which is an anti-pattern, a little confusing.
 Also, the 'x' icon has a small hit-box, making it harder to click.

Nielson's Heuristics (1200 words)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JUSTIFY SEVERITIES
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nielson's heuristics are a general guideline on user interface design.
 In this section, these ten characteristics will be examined in regards
 to six scenarios:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What a current student should do about COVID-19
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What support for Maori students is available
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How to find a specific lecture theatre
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What is academic integrity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Find out where to get a coffee on campus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ask about something in the Maori language
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process for gathering issues started with an observation and exploration
 of the main AskAuckland web page, looking specifically for anti-patterns
 and visual issues.
 Following this, the scenarios were carried out whilst constantly examining
 signs of usability issues.
 These were all recorded and then categorized into the ten heuristics.
 The criticality of each issue is noted and determined by the impact on
 users trying to perform a scenario.
 There are three levels of criticality: low, medium, and high.
 If an issue completely blocks a scenario then it is of high criticality,
 while an issue that annoys a user would be of low criticality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Visibility of system status
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through
 appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Previous Clicked Link Not Purple - Low Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A convention across many websites is to color links purple if they have
 been previously visited.
 This helps the user recognise what they have used before for future searches.
 Although missing this feature reduces the ability of users to recognise
 which articles they have already visited, it is not serious enough to hinder
 any tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Match between system and the real world
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts
 familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.
 Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and
 logical order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Maori Language Support - High Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Searching does not work if the language used to search is Maori.
 There is also no option to change the language of the site to be in Maori.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename no-results-maori.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Either translate Maori and search that way, or implement Maori
 language support with a switch language button
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
User control and freedom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked
 "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through
 an extended dialogue.
 Support undo and redo.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Search Term Not Saved
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When in an article, clicking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Current students
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 breadcrumb does not preserve the search term used to find the article.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename blank-search.PNG

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Add another breadcrumb which is shown when in articles, allowing
 the user to go back to their previous search term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Consistency and standards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or
 actions mean the same thing.
 Follow platform conventions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Choosing Topic Eliminates Relevant Results - High Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Searching for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

covid-19
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 yields twelve results, adding the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coronavirus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topic reduces the number of results to two.
 This is disconcerting as the topic and search terms are synonyms, but many
 important results are omitted.
 Therefore, the risk is high that user's would miss articles and not be
 able to complete their scenario if they encounter this issue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename covid-after.PNG
	scale 65

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Better tagging of search results, articles which mention coronavirus
 should be tagged with the corresponding topic.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Inconsistent Link Styling - Low Severity

\begin_layout Standard
While most links are colored blue, there are some exceptions.
 The

Example: How do I pay my fees?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 paragraph is not a link even though it is blue.
 The current breadcrumb is a link even though it is not colored blue.
 Links in the footer are not blue but white.
 Also hover animations for links vary as well.
 This issue is only a minor a
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Make all links blue

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Inconsistent Hover Styling - Low Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Links and buttons do not have consistent styling

\begin_layout Subsection
Error prevention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents
 a problem from occurring in the first place.
 Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users
 with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Misspelling Not Checked - Medium Severity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is quite a common mistake for user's to make.
 So the fact that there is no indication that there has been a misspelling
 (something like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

No results, please check your spelling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) is an issue.
 If a user is not a native English speaker, or their spelling is not accurate,
 this error could prevent them from completing a scenario, but most users
 would check their search term again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Solution: Instead of the message 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 add the phrase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Recognition rather than recall
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Minimize the user's memory load by making objects, actions, and options

Aesthetic and minimalist design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed.

 units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

Although error messages were rare, there were occasions where searching
 for something after the site had been idle results in an error message.
 The error message is not useful for the user.
 After searching again, the warning did not occur again.
 This is a confusing experience for the user.

Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation,
 it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.
