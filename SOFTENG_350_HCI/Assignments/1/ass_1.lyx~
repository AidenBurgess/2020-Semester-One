 yields five results.
 Further specifying the search by adding the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 topic reduces search results to just two results.
 The implementation of topics seems to be faulty.

 topic is counter-intuitive and not a good user experience (which part of

Typing in a word then hovering over the x icon does not change mouse cursor
