\begin_layout Standard
The user needs section is excellent.
 The user needs that are identified are interesting and clearly relevant
 for university students working in a group.
 Also, the explanations of what the user needs represent are clear.
 I found the section on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intelligence need
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to be very informing.
 Furthermore, there are examples given of possible solutions and what currently
 exists in other systems.
 It was also clear that the user needs directly influenced the teams design
 decisions, as images of how these user needs were implemented were shown
 alongside the explanations.

Improvement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usage testing results are a bit lacking in terms of discussion and implications.
 There are two areas that are identified as problematic, and they are described
 properly and given reasonable solutions.
 However, these changes are both based on quantitative observations.
 This is due to there being no qualitative results, so problems with how
 the UI is used can't be discovered.
 When taking into account these observations, more discussion can occur
 and greater changes can be made to improve the application.

\begin_layout Standard
The usage testing results section was clearly laid out and followed a logical
 structure.
 It was pleasing to see both quantitative and qualitative results being
 examined and discussed.
 There were many solutions proposed for future iterations, and these solutions
 were derived from clear analysis and reasoning as to why the previous implement
ation was not ideal.
 One particular part of this section that was outstanding was the use of
 Likert Scales and the clear presentation of the information gathered using
 this system.

Improvement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prototype description section does specify the user needs, however I
 feel they were not explained or described in enough detail.
 Some reasoning as to why these user needs are related to university students
 would be helpful.
 It would also be good to see a greater variety of user needs, as the four
 chosen relate to functionality.
 Some ecological or emotional user needs would strengthen this section of
 the report.
 However, it was commendable to discern the components of the application
 those particular user needs were associated with.
