\begin_layout Standard
Priya, a software engineering student, was interested in how her home network
 assigned her laptop an IP number, when she connected to the network, so
 she did a Wireshark capture.
 The above figure is the Wireshark trace of the moments when DHCP dynamically
 assign IP-address (Links to an external site.) parameters (and other things)
 to her laptop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the above trace discuss the four-step process to dynamically assign
 an IP address to the laptop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Identify the four steps in the trace, give their packet numbers, and discuss
 what happens in the step.
 - Done
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each step be sure to also state what the source and destination IP addresses
 are, what the port addresses will be.
 - Done
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Discuss how long the laptop will have the IP address, as well as discuss
 three other important pieces of information that the DHCP protocol will
 provide to Priyaâ€™s laptop about the network it has connected to.
 You will need to justify why these pieces of information are important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some networks are set up to automatically recognise specific devices by
 their MAC address, and always assign them the same IP address.
 State whether this is the case here, and justify your answer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Make sure your entire answer is supported by values, where relevant, from
 the above Wireshark trace.
 Your answer should be around 200-250 words.

\begin_layout Standard
The four steps to dynamically assign an IP address to the laptop are: DHCP
 Discover, DHCP Offer, DHCP Request, and DHCP ACK.
 The client in a DHCP conversation is given the port number 68, and the
 server is given port number 67.
 In the first step the host (laptop) broadcasts a DHCP Discover message
 to all machines on the network.
 Then, the server responds with a DHCP Offer message.
 This is also broadcast to the entire network as the laptop does not have
 an IP address yet.
 Then the host requests an IP address using the DHCP Request message broadcast
 to the network.
 Then the server sends back with the IP address using a DHCP ACK message
 broadcast.
 Every message in a DHCP conversation contains a transaction ID, to prevent
 retransmission errors and to keep track of the conversation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The laptop will have the IP address for 10 days, as that is the value of
 the

 field in the DHCP ACK message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DHCP protocol also provides:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Address of the first-hop router for client to allow the client to make requests
 to hosts outside of the local network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Name and IP address of DNS server to allow the client to retrieve IP information
 about websites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Network mask tells the client how many bits of the ip addresses are for
 hosts and subnets.

\begin_layout Standard
The DNS is a distributed hierarchical database with, root name servers,
 top-level domain servers and authoritative DNS servers.
 Consider the scenario where the IP address for weather.geek.nz was needed
 by a host but the name is not cached in the local DNS name server.
 Discuss the recursive solution where the IP address for weather.geek.nz would
 be retrieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The local DNS server would then contact the root DNS server, which would
 give back information about which top-level domain server to query.
 The process would repeat again, retrievin information about the authoritative
 DNS server.
 Once this server is queried, it will return the IP address for weather.geek.nz

b) need to pad this out (4)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using your answers in Question 3(a) explain why routers have forwarding
 tables, and the concept of route aggregation in a forwarding table.
 Your answer should be about 150 words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Route aggregation: combining of multiple smaller prefixes into larger ones.
 This allows more efficient advertisement of routing information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Routers have forwarding tables to allow for fast and efficient routing of
 packets.
 This process needs to be done quickly to prevent queueing at the router.
 Each packet that is seen by the router is passed onto other routers via
 the forwarding table.
 These forwarding tables match IP addresses to certain outputs and are computed
 using routing algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
c) (1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No, as the packets sent using TCP may be lost or retransmitted, layer 4
 still needs to handle out-of-order data.
 Layer 3 ensures that packets broken down into datagrams are able to be
 reassembled in the correct order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
4 - mild
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
a) (2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use TCP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data is guaranteed to be delivered to the client, as TCP automatically retransmi
ts packets.
 This is more reliable than UDP and ensures all the data is collected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data is guaranteed to be delivered to the receiver with no errors as TCP
 checks for errors.
 This allows for lower effort on the application layer dealing with errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The arrival of data using TCP will be in order, so the application layer
 will not need to handle out of order images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TCP allows for graceful shutdown of the connection between sender and receiver,
 so they know when the connection has been terminated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
b) (3) 100 words
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NAT is network address translation.
 This method allows a local network to only use one external IP address.
 The IP addresses of devices on the local network are not visible to the
 external hosts and are not explicitly addressable.
 This violates the end to end argument as external hosts are not talking
 directly with hosts within a NAT network.
 Instead, they talk through an intermediary NAT router, which interferes
 in the conversation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
c) (3)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the subnet mask takes 20 bits and an IP address has 32 bits.
 This leaves 12 bits for hosts on the network.
 Therefore, there can be a maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{12}=4096$
\end_inset

 hosts.
 The maximum amount if 20 hosts were routers is therefore 4076 hosts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
d) (2) - unsure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The requests are sent through the same socket of the DNS server.
 They are distinguished by their unique identification numbers.
 Each query and reply pair have the same identification number.
