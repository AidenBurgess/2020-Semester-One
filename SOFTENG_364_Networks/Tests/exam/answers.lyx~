\begin_layout Standard
The four steps to dynamically assign an IP address to the laptop are: DHCP
 Discover, DHCP Offer, DHCP Request, and DHCP ACK.
 The client in a DHCP conversation is given the port number 68, and the
 server is given port number 67.
 In the first step the host (laptop) broadcasts a DHCP Discover message
 to all machines on the network.
 Then, the server responds with a DHCP Offer message.
 This is also broadcast to the entire network as the laptop does not have
 an IP address yet.
 Then the host requests an IP address using the DHCP Request message broadcast
 to the network.
 Then the server sends back with the IP address using a DHCP ACK message
 broadcast.
 Every message in a DHCP conversation contains a transaction ID, to prevent
 retransmission errors and to keep track of the conversation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The laptop will have the IP address for 10 days, as that is the value of
 the

 field in the DHCP ACK message.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DHCP protocol also provides:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Address of the first-hop router for client to allow the client to make requests
 to hosts outside of the local network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Name and IP address of DNS server to allow the client to retrieve IP information
 about websites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Network mask tells the client how many bits of the ip addresses are for
 hosts and subnets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Some networks are set up to automatically recognise specific devices by
 their MAC address, and always assign them the same IP address.
 State whether this is the case here, and justify your answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It appears that this network does assign the same IP address to a specific
 MAC address, as after the DHCP release message, the same IP address is
 offered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DNS is a distributed hierarchical database with, root name servers,
 top-level domain servers and authoritative DNS servers.
 Consider the scenario where the IP address for weather.geek.nz was needed
 by a host but the name is not cached in the local DNS name server.
 Discuss the recursive solution where the IP address for weather.geek.nz would
 be retrieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The local DNS server would then contact the root DNS server, which would
 give back information about which top-level domain server to query.
 The process would repeat again, retrievin information about the authoritative
 DNS server.
 Once this server is queried, it will return the IP address for weather.geek.nz

\begin_layout Subsection*
b) need to pad this out (4)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using your answers in Question 3(a) explain why routers have forwarding
 tables, and the concept of route aggregation in a forwarding table.
 Your answer should be about 150 words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Route aggregation: combining of multiple smaller prefixes into larger ones.
 This allows more efficient advertisement of routing information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Routers have forwarding tables to allow for fast and efficient routing of
 packets.
 This process needs to be done quickly to prevent queueing at the router.
 Each packet that is seen by the router is passed onto other routers via
 the forwarding table.
 These forwarding tables match IP addresses to certain outputs and are computed
 using routing algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
c) (1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No, as the packets sent using TCP may be lost or retransmitted, layer 4
 still needs to handle out-of-order data.
 Layer 3 ensures that packets broken down into datagrams are able to be
 reassembled in the correct order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
4 - mild
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
a) (2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use TCP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data is guaranteed to be delivered to the client, as TCP automatically retransmi
ts packets.
 This is more reliable than UDP and ensures all the data is collected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data is guaranteed to be delivered to the receiver with no errors as TCP
 checks for errors.
 This allows for lower effort on the application layer dealing with errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The arrival of data using TCP will be in order, so the application layer
 will not need to handle out of order images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TCP allows for graceful shutdown of the connection between sender and receiver,
 so they know when the connection has been terminated.

\begin_layout Standard
NAT is network address translation.
 This method allows a local network to only use one external IP address.
 The IP addresses of devices on the local network are not visible to the
 external hosts and are not explicitly addressable.
 This violates the end to end argument as external hosts are not talking
 directly with hosts within a NAT network.
 Instead, they talk through an intermediary NAT router, which interferes
 in the conversation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
c) (3) - needs to be fixed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the subnet mask takes 20 bits and an IP address has 32 bits.
 This leaves 12 bits for hosts on the network.
 Therefore, there can be a maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{12}=4096$
\end_inset

 hosts.
 The maximum amount if 20 hosts were routers is 4076 hosts as each router
 has an IP address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
d) (2) - unsure, what about ip and port number
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The requests are sent through the same socket of the DNS server.
 They are distinguished by their unique identification numbers.
 Each query and reply pair have the same identification number.
 The hosts are also identified by their ip and port numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
1 7/10 a little tough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Drone Swarm Rescue System (DSRS) project is growing in size.
 The initial prototype, with multiple drones communicating over Wi-Fi, has
 been a huge success.
 The prototype has shown multiple drones can communicate with each other
 and build their own private network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project has been so successful that it has attracted funding from several
 US government organisations.
 And while they like the current work, they want to open up the network
 so other organisations (e.g.
 US companies) can provide drones as part of the swarm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a requirement of the funding, other organisations need to add their own
 “sub-nets” of drones.
 These sub-nets will consist of multiple drones implementing their own network.
 But the multiple sub-nets will need to communicate with each other.
 One way to model this design is to treat each sub-net as a separate autonomous
 system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Using your knowledge of routing between autonomous systems, discuss the
 benefits and costs of using a BGP-like protocol for DSRS.
 Include details of how ICMP could be used to help diagnose problems between
 the different sub-nets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BGP: Border Gateway Protocol.
 Inter-domain routing protocol (holds the internet together).
 Includes eBGP: obtain subnet reachability information from neighbouring
 ASes and iBGP: propagate reachability routes to other networks based on
 reachability information and policy.
 Built on top of TCP, semi-permanent connection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This allows specific drones to connect to other drone sub-nets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Section*
3 - hmm pretty tough
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that the DSRS project is expanding, security has become an important
 issue.
 The various funders are requiring that the drones in the swarm are secure
 and that an outside hacker would not be able to either observe what is
 happening in the swarm or take over any drones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To meet the funders’ requirements, the lead designers in the DSRS have decided
 to implement a multiple level security system.
 They desire all messages in the system to be confidential and authenticated,
 while ensuring that the services are always available.
 Knowing the risks of implementing their own protocols, they have decided
 to use pre-existing protocols, including SSL and public key cryptography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the multiple level approach, the designers have decided to split the
 network into three security zones.
 The first zone will contain all the drones (both relay and search) and
 allow free communications between them.
 The second zone will contain the operators and allow two-way communications
 between the drones and operators.
 The third zone will be a public zone that only allows one-way traffic out
 from the operator zone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The designers want to ensure that each zone is secure and only allows the
 authorised traffic between the different zones.
 However, given they have complete control over the networks protocols in
 the network, they are sure they can lock down the network while still allowing
 normal operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Using your knowledge of SSL and operational security, describe how the three
 zones could be configured and what additional infrastructure would be required.
 Include details of the data flows between the three zones and how each
 data flow would be secured.

\begin_layout Standard
The drones in DSRS have a number of sensors and actuators that allow the
 operators to both perceive and interact with the world.
 These sensors include microphones, videos and speakers.
 Given the DSRS system allows manoeuvring drones close to people who need
 rescuing, the project sponsors have decided the system could also be useful
 for communicating with these people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To meet the project sponsors’ requests, the designers have decided to implement
 functionality that would allow for a conversation between an operator and
 another person via a drone.
 As the operator could be operating multiple drones, they need to be able
 to switch between multiple conversations or merge multiple conversations
 into a single conference conversation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Using your knowledge of multimedia networking, discuss what issues need
 to be considered implementing the conversation functionality.
